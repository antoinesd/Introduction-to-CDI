____
*CDI* brings a _powerful_ and _modern_ programming _model_ that standardizes _good practices_.

*CDI* provides a _consistent_ and _seamless_ way to _integrate_ 3rd party frameworks to this _model_.

Once adopted, *CDI* will become the _invisible backbone_ of our projects.

== One container to rule them all

CAUTION: The container is the heart of CDI

CAUTION: The container checks all possible CDI code at boot time

CAUTION: The container manages your components lifecycle and services

CAUTION: Yet, you'll never see it (except in advanced development)

== DI explained to your granny 1/3


TIP: Dependency Injection delegates to a *container*/*injector*/*manager*...

TIP: ...the *creation* (and *disposal*) of classes' instances...

TIP: ...and the *assignment* of these instances to *fields* or *parameters*...

TIP: ...in consuming code.

TIP: Without DI

[source, subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public class EnglishHelloService implements HelloService {
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }
}

public class MyBean {
    private HelloService service = *new EnglishHelloService()*; //<1>
}
----
<1> instantiation and assignment is done in code
